                                                         yet its recent slowdown raises concerns about accelerating climate change.
                                                         Variations in wetland C sequestration are hypothesized to play a key role in
                                                         this shift. Here we mapped annual water levels in global wetlands from 2000 to

                                                         by an increase thereafter. Overall, wetland C sequestration was roughly stable
